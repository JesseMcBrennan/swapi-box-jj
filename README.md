# SWAPI-Box

SWAPI-Box is a custom-made UI interfacing with the Starwars API. The UI allows a user to pick specific Starwars related data and have it render to the screen. SWAPI-box demonstrates our ability to work with nested data in order to create a clean and usable UI.

##

To begin, select people, planets or vehicles. Click on an individual card in order to add it to the favorites section. Use your left or right scroll to move through the displayed cards.

## Team

SWAPI-Box is a collaboration between Joel O'Connor and Jesse McFadden. We used trello to manage tasks and a driver/navigator workflow for development.
